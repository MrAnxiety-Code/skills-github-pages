## This is a simple GitHub Pages blog to learn how to make them using the GitHub pages tutorial.

I'm scared to post as me on the internet, realised it was making me shy IRL. So I'm trying being anonymous online to overcome that. I maintain a series of loosly connected Spreadsheets for a living, but I got back into writing code so I started a GitHub page to store it all. Also, learn how to use GitHub. I might also blog on here but maybe not in this repo. I might do that on one properly configured for that. All this is really just for learning right now.
